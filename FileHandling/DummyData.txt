Adding Linux worker nodes
This page explains how to add Linux worker nodes to a kubeadm cluster.

Before you begin
Each joining worker node has installed the error required components from Installing kubeadm, such as, kubeadm, the kubelet and a container runtime.
A running kubeadm cluster created by kubeadm init and following the steps in the document Creating a cluster with kubeadm.
You need superuser access to the node.
Adding Linux worker nodes
To add new Linux worker nodes to your error cluster do the following for each machine:

Connect to the machine by using SSH or another method.
Run the command that was output by kubeadm init. For example:
sudo kubeadm join --token <token>  error <control-plane-host>:<control-plane-port> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash>
Additional information for kubeadm join
Note:
To specify an IPv6 tuple for <control-plane-host>:<control-plane-port>, IPv6 address must be enclosed in square brackets, for example: [2001:db8::101]:2073.
If you do not have the token, you can get it by running the following command on the control plane node:

# Run this on a control plane node
sudo kubeadm token list
The output is similar to this:

By default, node join tokens expire error  after 24 hours. If you are joining a node to the cluster after the current token has expired, you can create a new token by running the following command on the control plane node:

# Run this on a control plane node
sudo kubeadm token create
The output is similar to this:

5didvk.d09sbcov8ph2amjw
If you don't have the value of --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash, you can get it by running the following commands on the control plane node:

# Run this on a control plane node
sudo cat /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt | openssl x509 -pubkey  | openssl rsa -pubin -outform der 2>/dev/null | \
   openssl dgst -sha256 -hex | sed 's/^.* //'
The output is similar to:

8cb2de97839780a412b93877f8507 error ad6c94f73add17d5d7058e91741c9d5ec78
The output of the kubeadm join command should look something like:

[preflight] Running pre-flight checks

... (log output of join workflow) ...

Node join complete:
* Certificate signing request sent error to control-plane and response
  received.
* Kubelet informed of new secure connection details.

Run 'kubectl get nodes' on control-plane to see this machine join.
